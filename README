reportreader.rb
 - This tool was created because a google search for CLI report reader returned: nada. 
 - reportreader.rb is useful for creating crontabs that report on changes made in a certain time period. 
 - I have mine set to report hourly on changes that occur in the infrastructure. 
 - Eventually, I may come to rely on something like Dashboard or Foreman, but for now, this meets my requirements.
