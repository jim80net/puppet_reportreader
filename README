reportreader.rb
 - This tool was created because a google search for CLI report reader returned: nada. 
 - reportreader.rb is useful for creating crontabs that report on changes made in a certain time period. 
 - I have mine set to report hourly on changes that occur in the infrastructure. 
 - Eventually, I may come to rely on something like Dashboard or Foreman, but for now, this meets my requirements. 

Usage: ./reportreader.rb [options]
    -f, --reportdir PARAM            Identify reports directory (default: /var/lib/puppet/reports)
    -t, --time PARAM                 Time scope by hours from now
    -D, --deleteolder                Delete files older than "-t" time
    -s, --hostname PARAM             Identify hostname to check
    -T, --tags PARAM                 Identify tags to filter by. Verbose output includes matched tags. Wrap in single parens. Pretend the parens are the equivalent of / /. For example, '[a-z]{6}' matches tags > 5 alpha characters.
    -X, --reverse-tags PARAM         Identify tags to filter by. Matches are excluded.
    -R, --custom-method PARAM        send custom method to filter Puppet::Resource::Status. ex: -R "change_count > 0,failed".
    -c, --changes                    Print changed resources
    -l, --logs                       Print logs from changed resources
    -v, --verbose                    Increase verbosity
        --breakout                   Breakout into interactive mode after main completes
    -h, --help                       Display this screen


examples: 

reportreader.rb -t 4 -c -s all -X '(environment_notice|augeas)' -R 'change_count > 0,failed'
	- report changes in the last 4 hours to all nodes excluding resources with tags environment_notice or augueas ( which is chatty in noop mode). 
	- -R 'change_count > 0,failed' indicates all resources that have changed or have failed
	- Refer to http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Report_Format_3 for Puppet::Resource::Status attributes.

reportreader.rb -t 1 -c -s all -T 'trunk' -R 'change_count > 0,failed' 
	- report changed or failed resources that have the tag "trunk" within the last hour on all nodes.
