=[reportreader.rb]
This tool was created because a google search for CLI report reader
returned: nada. reportreader.rb is useful for creating crontabs that i
report on changes made in a certain time period. I have mine set to 
report hourly on changes. Eventually, I may come to rely on something 
like Dashboard or Foreman, but for now, this meets my requirements.

      -c, --changes                    Print changed resources. equivalent to -R 'change_count > 0,failed'
      -l, --logs                       Print logs from changed resources

==[examples]: 

 reportreader.rb -t 4 -c -s all -X '(trunk|augeas)'

	with tags trunk or augueas (which is chatty in noop mode).

	report changed or failed resources that have the tag "trunk" within 
	the last hour on all nodes. 

 reportreader.rb -t 1 -s all -R 'resource == "Service[samba]"'
